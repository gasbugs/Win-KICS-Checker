.SYNOPSIS
    Checks for regular review and reporting of logs.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script addresses the procedural requirement for regular review, analysis, and reporting of security, application, and system logs.
    This is a human process that cannot be automated by a script.
    Therefore, this check reports 'Manual Check Required'.

.OUTPUTS
    A JSON object indicating the check item, category, result, and details.
